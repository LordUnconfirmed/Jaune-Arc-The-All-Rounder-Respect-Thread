“I’ve always known that Semblances alone aren’t the only aspect of becoming a powerful Huntsman or Huntress, but I’m still catching up from a practical standpoint, so I’m learning a lot with every single spar I take part in,” Jaune admitted.

“Well, you're going to have to learn quickly if you want to beat Brittany Fluorette tomorrow,” Yang suddenly cautioned. “She’s an outlier in the rankings, as she should be somewhere in the middle of the pack. She can move at least 5 times normal speeds, and she makes the most of her Semblance with that weapon she uses.”

“I might be able to get my speed up to 3.5 times normal by tomorrow if I’m successful at upping my aura control to 20 percent,” Jaune brainstormed out loud.

“With your muscles, 3.5 times the norm is more like 4.5, so you might not end up being that much slower than Brittany, but I still think we need to arrange a training exercise for you tonight,” Pyrrha announced.

“I’ll take part in whatever you decide to offer me,” Jaune immediately agreed.
