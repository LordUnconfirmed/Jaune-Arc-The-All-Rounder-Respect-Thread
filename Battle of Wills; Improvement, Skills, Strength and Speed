Casting his eyes from one side of the vast room to the other, Jaune could see that he was being stared at by quite literally everyone in the room. Unfortunately for Jaune, the scrutiny that he was currently being shown wasn't all that mysterious. There were just too many inconsistencies where he was concerned for anything about him to make sense to the rest of his class.

On the first day of classes, Jaune was slower than even the slowest and weakest boy in the class, and he only won the fight that he’d taken part in because he’d shamelessly exploited Shale Pines’ weakness of both Semblance and character.

On the second day of classes, Jaune was quite a bit faster, fought better, and displayed what might be some kind of telekinesis Semblance when he floated a small cloud of rocks within Aiden Ochre’s incorporeal chest.

Once again on the third day of classes, Jaune moved faster and fought better, making it seem as if he’d just been moving at half speed on purpose up until that point, so that his opponents would actually stand a chance...

Then, finally, just four minutes earlier, Jaune had bested Breccia Coal, when her seismic air Semblance seemed to just pass directly through him to damage the wall at his back, making it seem like he had more than one Semblance, which of course everyone knew was completely impossible…

Long story short, no one in the stands knew what to make of ‘John Freeman’ at the moment,’ and they were stuck staring at him as a result.

Jaune tried very hard to act as if he didn’t even notice the scrutiny that he was receiving as he walked around the circular stands to sit down among his friends. Every member of his Platoon seemed to know exactly what he was up to, as they were all giving him looks of poorly hidden amusement.
