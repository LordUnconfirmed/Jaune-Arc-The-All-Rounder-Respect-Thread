. “I’m really grateful for your help, Ruby, so I want you to let me know if there are any ways that I can pay you back.”

“Why don’t you help maintain and sharpen Ruby’s weapon then,” Penny casually suggested from her spot just to Ruby’s right.

While Jaune perked up at the excellent suggestion, Ruby merely looked confused.

After catching sight of Ruby’s puzzled expression, Jaune raised a finger in a ‘just a moment’ gesture, ran to the corner of the room to grab up a mundane sword. Ran back over to Ruby and then picked up a nearby block of wood used to hold things in place. First, he pressed the edge of the wooden block against the sword edge and nothing happened. The sword was dull. Then, he slowly ran his finger down the edge of the sword blade, leaving behind a faint yellow tinge that quickly ebbed away. Finally, he pressed the wood against the sword edge again, and it split down the middle as if the sword was a scalpel cutting through air. Zero resistance, zero friction. He’d sharpened the sword down to a monomolecular edge…

Fwump…

Penny just barely managed to catch Ruby’s armpits, as the girl’s legs completely gave out from under her.

“Able to repair, clean and sharpen weapons down to the molecular level,” Ruby breathed out, staring up at Jaune as if he was a unicorn riding a dragon.

“Uhhh yeah… got it in one,” Jaune confirmed.

“This, this is big, this is special, this is… I might have to give you a cookie,” Ruby breathed out as she slowly rose back up to her feet.

“Your help developing my weapons is more than enough for me,” Jaune assured as he turned back towards his designs. “Would you like to take a look?”
