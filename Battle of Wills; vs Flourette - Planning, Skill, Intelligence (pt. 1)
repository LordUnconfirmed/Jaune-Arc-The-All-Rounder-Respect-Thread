“You both know the rules, so I shall not speak of them,” Goodwitch called out as she queued up the hologram to show their aura levels and statistics to the rest of the audience. ”Are you ready?”

Both Jaune and Brittany nodded their heads. Yes… He was ready…

“Fight,” Goodwitch barked out before leaping away to the side of the arena.

It was Goodwitch’s immediate movement to the side of the room that alerted Jaune to what was about to happen, and he immediately leapt backwards to do the same. In doing so, he barely managed to avoid being cut to ribbons by a wide swatch of different blades that flew through the air almost too fast to see.

In the split second after the fight started, the chain sickles that were wrapped all around Brittany’s body exploded outwards in a massive swath of wide swinging circles that cut in every direction without the girl ever moving a single muscle. Was this magnetism?… No… The chains were clearly bouncing off of each other at random rather than moving with any coordination. This girl had a method to manipulate the metal in her weapon, but it wasn’t an absolute variety of control.

Even before Jaune landed at the side of the arena, the chains wrapped around both of Brittany’s wrists bounced back to collect around her waist again, but by then she was already aura dashing in his direction with two of the sickles in hand.

Jaune circle strafed to the right with his sword and shield at the ready, at which point he saw that Brittany was moving at least 5 times her baseline norm because she had a noticeable speed advantage on him. Jaune couldn’t avoid the woman using normal movements and evasions, but judging from her tiny little arms, he probably had a leg up on her in regards to raw strength.

Jaune would take speed over strength any day of the week, but he was used to making due with what he had and in that sense today would be no different.

Brittany Fluorette closed the distance with him, waved her sickles at his head which in turn forced him to leap aside, and then when he was committed and flying through the air, her chain sickles suddenly jangled loudly, whipped out in his direction, and were swerving towards his face.

Jaune raised his rifle-shield to block some of the sickles, and he used his hand to grab yet another before it could cut into his aura field, but he missed several more as they slashed at his thighs and legs and feet. Then the alternate side of the chain sickle weapons, the weighted base on the other end of the chains were flying in Jaune’s direction from behind, and over a dozen Dust rounds were slamming into Jaune’s back to propel him forward through the air.

Somehow, without having to touch the guns attached to the unbladed ends of her chains, Brittany could make those Dust pistols turn in his direction and then fire. Her ability manipulated the metal. Her ability had something to do with the reason her weapons were made of iron, a metal that was rarely used anymore because of the advent of Unobtanium. Even as Jaune was forced into a messy forward roll to avoid another volley of Dust rounds, he was channeling a massive amount of aura into his brain to slow down his perception of time and find out what Brittany was doing.

Even as Jaune rose to his feet, a kick slammed into his thigh, a sickle in Brittany’s hand sliced at his left forearm, and then the rest of the chains were whipping in his direction from both sides like an iron maiden closing. Jaune leapt backwards again, and then kicked off of the wall at his back as hard as he could to body check Brittany and break free of her trap. Then he was being judo thrown over her shoulder, and it was only by holding onto her armpit that he managed to avoid being slammed down into the ground.

This was bad. Jaune was being overwhelmed. Jaune needed to start learning the pattern of her attacks so that he could dodge her flurry of blows.
