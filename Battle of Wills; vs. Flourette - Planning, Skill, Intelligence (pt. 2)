Jaune needed to start learning the pattern of her attacks so that he could dodge her flurry of blows.

And that’s when he heard that sound again, and he started wondering what it meant

Jangle! Jangle!

Even as he leapt backwards once again to avoid a persistently waving series of harassing chains, Jaune’s aura bolstered perception saw that small protrusions of iron were growing out from within the chain segments to slam against the floor and other chains and rocket the chain sickles through the air. These protrusions… these growths…

Brittany was an alchemist… She could manipulate the metal, specifically the iron in her weapon, to make it move in her desired direction, bounce and turn in the air, and depress the trigger of a Dust pistol without having to physically touch it.

The only reason Jaune was still in the fight up until now was simple. It appeared that Brittany could only cause these protrusions to explode into place in large groups all at once rather than hundreds of them at random all of the time. If Jaune paid attention to that jangling noise and then watched where and in what direction the protrusions were pushing the different chain sickles, he might be able to dodge the attacks that followed.

Yeah… simple… not!…

Jaune assigned a part of his fully aura saturated brain to mapping out the trajectory of the various sickles, timed it to happen when he heard that jangling noise, and then began moving in to attempt an attack of his own. He had a plan in mind at this point, but he needed to look like he was trying to hurt his opponent in a normal way in order for his real intentions to remain undiscovered. He managed to avoid the first swing of Brittany’s chains and then sidestep and second despite the fact that it should have come as a surprise when they changed direction at random behind him. He saw the moment when Brittany realized that he was on to her and was modifying his movements. He saw the dangerous glint in her eyes and he recognized that she was about to step up her efforts.
