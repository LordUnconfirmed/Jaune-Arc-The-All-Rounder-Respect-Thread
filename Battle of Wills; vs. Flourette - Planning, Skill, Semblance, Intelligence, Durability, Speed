He saw the dangerous glint in her eyes and he recognized that she was about to step up her efforts.

A tidal wave of sickles careened down towards Jaune’s face, he rolled forward to avoid them, they jangled and pursued him, he rolled to the left and a crater was gouged into the floor where he’d just been laying. He grabbed a hold of several of the segments and attempted to pull Brittany through the air, only for a rash of sharp little protrusions to grow out of the side of the chains and cut into the aura field over Jaune’s hands. He slapped a wide segment of chains away seemingly in frustration as he rose to his feet. His aura field had dropped down to below 60 percent at this point because of the hundreds of Dust rounds that were pinging off of his back and the slashes that were sliding along his legs and thighs. Completely avoiding Brittany’s weapons appeared to be impossible even as Jaune recognized how the woman used her weapons and grew more efficient at avoiding the worst of her attacks.

Over the next minute or two, Jaune sidestepped and backpedalled and rolled his way through a constantly sweeping flow of blades and guns and chains as he attempted to make headway in the direction of his opponent. His sword and his shield were a blur of motion as he slammed aside and parried hundreds and hundreds of blows.

Almost without even realizing it, Jaune finally managed to get himself close enough to swing his sword in Brittany’s direction. The sickles in her hands intercepted his attack and held it in place long enough for her chain sickles to attempt to wrap around him from every single side, Jaune slapped and punched the chains away, seemingly in a desperate attempt to try for a second attack, and then was forced to back away when a volley of Dust rounds reduced his aura to 52 percent. As he broke away, Jaune fired 2 dozen Dust rounds from his rifle-shield that Brittany blocked by wrapping her chains all around her body.

Brittany looked like she was having fun.

So did Jaune.

Brittany noticed the smile on Jaune’s face, and hers dimmed a little in response.

Then she noticed it. There were dozens and dozens of dull yellow splotches attached to the iron chains that were currently wrapped all around her body. Her eyes widened in surprise, they flicked up to Jaune’s, they contained an odd sense of fatalism…

Jaune’s face suddenly scrunched up in effort, and it happened. The segments of chain wrapped around Brittany’s waist and arms, instantly turned red hot, caught fire and began burning like red hot slag against Brittany’s aura fielded body. Brittany immediately yelped in pain, dropped to the floor on her side, and began trying to use her Semblance to begin bouncing the segments of chain away from her body. Too bad for her, the newly red hot metal completely ignored her ability. Something was changing the chemical makeup of her chains so that they weren’t iron anymore, or at least they weren’t only iron anymore, and the process was making them catch fire directly against her skin.

Over the next couple of seconds, the segments of chain that were on fire started turning a dull red colour before dropping away like sand or… rust…

Over the course of their fight, Jaune had recruited a massive amount of pure oxygen from the air, and then combined it with the iron comprising Brittany’s weapon whenever he touched it with his hands. Then, when he was finally ready to spring his trap, he forced the oxygen and the iron to meld together in a process called oxidation. Under normal circumstances, when a metal oxidizes and ends up becoming rusty, it happens very very slowly and the heat that the process gives off is negligible. When that same process happens within only a matter of seconds however… the heat that it gives off is immense…

Brittany gasped in surprise once again as large segments of her fiery red weapons turned to red flakes of powder and then dropped to the floor, but then a sword was slamming down into her head, her face was slamming into the ground, and a foot was cratering her face down into the concrete of the floor over and over again. Jaune slammed his sword into the woman’s back and shoulders, kicked her head as hard as he could and fired dust round after Dust round into her hands and feet to keep her unbalanced.

Finally, finally, after almost half a minute spent delivering a completely savage one sided beating, Brittany Fluorette’s aura levels dropped below 10 percent, and the fight was at an end.

“Winner, John Freeman,” Professor Goodwitch called out, ending the fight with no specific emotion in her voice.
