The return trip to the airfield took a long damned time, and it wasn't without mishap either. At one point Jaune slipped off of a particularly tree sap covered branch and just barely managed to catch himself before plummeting to the ground below. There was also the time when he somehow managed to force a pine needle directly into the eye, blinding himself and forcing his aura to heal him. Finally, after Monty only knows how long, Jaune found himself perched in a massive tree that was lining the airfield and staring down at the Bullhead below. Coincidentally, he could also see the Cthulhu Grimm's corpse slowly turning into a black mist off in the distance. Booyah! Score one for the humans.
