Finally, when the light from the airfield was only visible as a grey cloud on the skyline, Jaune suddenly leapt up against the bare trunk of a pine tree and wrapped his body around its length. This particular type of tree didn't have any branches until it began sprouting needles much higher up in the tree. The tree's lack of branches was about to make it both uncomfortable and highly strenuous for Jaune to climb. Thankfully, this upcoming struggle was also going to be the reason why Jaune's trick was going to work. Very few of his father's people believed he was anything but a soft, pampered, weakling of a boy. Not one of them would believe that he'd subject himself to a pine needle hell such as the one above his head.

Wellâ€¦ They were wrong.

After about three frantic minutes spent climbing by hugging onto the tree trunk like a sloth, Jaune finally managed to wiggle his body up into the dense foliage level of the pine. Then, after just a few moments spent catching his breath, he launched himself through the air towards another pine tree that was growing nearby. Ouch... He'd been right. The needles pressing into his skin hurt like Hell even with his diminished aura protecting him. It was still worth it.
