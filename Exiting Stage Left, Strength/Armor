With a sigh and a shake of his head, Jaune resigned himself to following Penny's advice. He had all of these really cool weapons and yet he always seemed to gravitate towards the traditional arms that an Arc family Hunter would use. The Arcs always tended towards using a sword and shield combo, so for a good long time, he'd tried to avoid them. The problem was that he didn't have a lifetime's familiarity with something with a hundred different uses like a machine gun, chain sickle, with blades for magazines... Jaune knew how to block, block and stab, stab, with a sword shield combo just fine, and when you have a high-powered rifle hidden in the spine of the shield, it becomes pretty dangerous for the enemy to try and break away. Better yet, with his armor bolstered strength, Jaune can and had punched a Beowulf's head clear off its shoulders with the knuckle duster attached to his saber. Still... Lame... It was all just so lame. Damn. Jaune was never going to be the cool kid at school...

With one last fond smile in Penny's direction, Jaune affixed the weapons to his back and dashed out of the door. He needed to hurry if he was going to finish his newest assignment with the best possible timing.
