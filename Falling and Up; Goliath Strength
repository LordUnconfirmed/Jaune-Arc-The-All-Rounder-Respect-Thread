After about 4 minutes spent climbing, Jaune and Blake had finally dropped down far enough that the cliffside beneath them was worn completely smooth by a mixture of water and time, and they ran out of nooks and crannies to hold onto. Thankfully, Jaune and Blake were low enough that they could finally see the series of very powerful floodlights that were rimming a span of rampart walls. That was also the moment when they managed to take in exactly what it was that they were dealing with, and they both just hung there on the cliffside with their mouths hanging open….

Grimm… Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of Grimm were pouring up the river valley like bugs, and slamming themselves against the Airfield’s fortifications.

The Airfield’s metallic rampart walls were extremely tall, but they weren’t anywhere near as heavily fortified as a Colony’s walls would be, which is why the 2 large machine gun emplacements sitting on the top of the rampart’s twin lookout towers were sending an unbroken chain of fiery red Dust rounds down into the seething mass of the Grimm bottlenecking in the kill zone. The Beowolves, Creeps, and heavily armored Ursa that were slamming into the fortifications weren’t the main cause of concern for the Airfield, even though they were beginning to pile up on top of each other at the base of the wall like ants. No… It was the overlarge A and B level Grimm that were entering the gorge, dragging a foreboding red testing area right along with them that were the real reason the Airfield was essentially screwed......

Even the B ranked Manticores that were prowling around near the back of the Grimm swarm weren’t Jaune’s primary concern. If those Goliath Grimm (elephant Grimm) managed to slam their tusks against the Airfield’s wall, it would explode into pieces small enough to fit into a wallet.
