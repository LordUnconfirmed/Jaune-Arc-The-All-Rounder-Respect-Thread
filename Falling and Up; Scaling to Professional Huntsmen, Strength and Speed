Over the next two minutes, Jaune explained his reactive armor and how the nanobots within it worked.

“You found a way to circumvent your weaknesses,” Blake summarized in a quiet voice. “Very resourceful…”

“To a point yes,” Jaune allowed with a shrug. “On the other hand, harnessing the suit is the main reason that I’ve become so frugal with my aura. While using the suit at a hundred percent power, I enjoy speed and strength comparable to that of someone with an S ranked melee Semblance, but only for the 4 and a half minutes that my aura can fuel it. More often than not, I use the suit at a much lower percentage, and if I’m going to be a healer and a battery, it might be best that I don’t activate it at all...”

“So your role will primarily be as a utility fighter then,” Blake brainstormed, even as she shoved a knife into an attacking Beowulf’s skull. “You’re a problem solver of sorts, healing and recovering by default, but capable of unleashing a powerful last ditch attack…”

“At the moment that’s about right, but in the future I hope to broaden the uses to which I can direct my Semblance and make progress as a martial artist,” Jaune finished.
