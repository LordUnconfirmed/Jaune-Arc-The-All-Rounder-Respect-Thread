While Jaune was fully aware that hemming himself in against the rock face was less than ideal if he ended up needing to retreat, it was still the safest option under the circumstances. He’d fought Beowolves before. He was rested and in fairly decent shape.... He was ready.

When they finally burst out of the trees on the other side of the clearing, the double sized pack of Beowolves began releasing a series of overexcited yips and feral sounding growls. They fanned out as they dashed in Jaune’s direction, until finally they were running in a semi-circle designed to surround him as efficiently as possible. In return, Jaune pushed down on the centerpiece of his Rifleshield, mechashifting it to reveal the barrel, stock and trigger of a rifle that rested atop his forearm.

As quickly and as accurately as he could, Jaune began firing shot after shot into the Grimm on the right hand side of their formation. While he knew for a fact that he wasn’t going to be able to avoid taking part in a melee fight, his number one priority was to thin out the ranks of the Beowolves that were trying to flank him. With that thought in mind, he delivered over a dozen Dust rounds into the Beowolves trailing to his right and then he switched his focus to the left to do exactly the same thing.

As the wings of the Beowulf pack took bullets to their brains and flopped down to a misty oblivion, the rest of the pack fanned out even more in order to hold their circular formation. In their determination to trap him against the rocks, less Beowolves were taking part in a frontal assault, and the ones that led the charge were forced to slow down to stay in formation.

So far so good.

Jaune was ruining the enemy’s advance, and the extra time that he was gaining would allow him to fire off about a dozen more rounds.

Sure enough, Jaune managed to drop 4 more Beowolves, 2 on both sides, before the pack was only 5 meters away and he was forced to mechashift his rifle back into a shield.
