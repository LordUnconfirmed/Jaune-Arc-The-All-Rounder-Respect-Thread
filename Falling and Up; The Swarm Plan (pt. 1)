“If we go down there, we won’t be able to come back up,” Blake whispered from just a few feet to Jaune’s left.

At first, John only nodded his head in agreement as he hung there with his fingers shoved between a series of jagged rocks. Both Jaune and Blake were confident that they could fight off several waves of the small and middling sized Grimm, but neither of them had the firepower necessary to take out those Manticores or Goliaths…

Then Jaune saw some of the materials that were just laying forgotten around the Airfield, and his eyes suddenly grew wide…

“Uhhh Blake,” Jaune started in a quiet voice. “If I had a reckless plan that might be able to destroy the A level threats, would you help me fight off the main body of the swarm until they come close enough?”

“How impossible is the plan,” Blake immediately asked, her eyes boring into the side of Jaune’s face.

“It’ll be a powerfully difficult use of my Semblance using several times more raw power and control than I’ve ever attempted to use before,” Jaune explained as he scanned the materials present down in the Airfield proper. I’ll need a volunteer from the Airfield staff to hook up what I need up on the ramparts, and I’ll need you to watch my back when it's finally time for me to make it work.”

With one last look at the boiling waves of Grimm scratching their way up the sides of the barrier walls, the Airfield staff with their ragtag collection of machine guns and pistols firing down off of the ramparts, and then finally at the Civilians huddled in the Airfield’s main terminal, Blake turned back to Jaune and nodded her head in assent. “I… I want to help those people… I think you might actually have a way to pull it off… I’m going to choose to trust you… Please don’t make me regret it.”

“You can act all remote and untrusting if you want Blake Belladonna,” Jaune immediately replied with a slow, bemused shake of his head. “It’s no use though. I can already tell that you’re secretly a massive softie.”

Then Jaune let go of the rocks that he’d been hanging onto, and began sliding down the side of the nearly vertical cliff towards the closest section of the Airfield’s rampart wall.
