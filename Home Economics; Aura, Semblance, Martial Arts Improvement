"If you agree not to cut any corners in my classes, then I'll meet with you in my office for an hour after last bell every day, and I'll help you quite a bit," Ms. Goodwitch quietly replied. Then, as if to prove that she wasn't all talk, the blonde educator immediately pulled out her scroll and cued up holo-footage of Jaune's actions up on the rampart wall. For the next minute and a half, the two of them quietly huddled around her scroll as they watched several small, professionally edited snippets of Jaune's fighting, as well as some of the hits that he'd taken when he hadn't reacted as well as he could have.

“After watching this holo-footage several different times, I’ve come to believe that it’s not actually your baseline strength, speed or coordination that’s to blame for your erratic and inconsistent fighting skills,” Goodwitch began in a very calm and nonjudgmental tone of voice. “There are aspects of your aura channeling that you appear to be performing manually that your body can accomplish all alone without your interference. I’m of the opinion that this bad habit is a side effect of your Semblance giving you such an advanced level of control over your inner aura. You’re micromanaging where your aura flows and what tasks it performs within your body, and doing so is splitting your focus into dozens of different directions even as you’re trying to fight and move. It's counterproductive and it's hindering you. In the days to come, I’m going to run you through a series of exercises that’ll teach you what aura applications your body does passively, as well as the various ways that you can direct your Semblance in a pinch to make yourself stronger, faster and far more durable.”

“Glynda Goodwitch… You’re completely extraordinary,” Jaune breathed out as he saw that the Professor standing at his side had gleaned more from a few snippets of camera footage than Taiyang had learned in the 2 whole weeks that they’d spent together…
