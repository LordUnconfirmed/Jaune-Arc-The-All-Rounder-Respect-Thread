“Does anyone in here know anything at all about the military,” Officer Oetger called out as she walked to the front of the almost completely empty auditorium. It appeared that attendance at this class was nonexistent at the moment, because the first-year class lacked any and all common sense. Jaune already knew that their current attendance problem was going to end when the various Platoon Captains started catching hell from the Professor Mentors. Thankfully for him, everyone in Platoon number 1 was sitting in the pews with their books out and pens at the ready.

With his primary focus dwelling on just how fortunate he was to lead the best Platoon in the whole entire school, John raised his hand in response to Officer Oetger’s question without any hesitation. Then he looked around and saw that he and Penny were the only 2 people that had done so.

“Oh, and where do the two of you come by this knowledge?” Officer Oetger didn’t look like she disbelieved them, but rather she looked like she was completely desperate for someone she could relate to.

After giving Penny a glance and getting a nod in return, Jaune cleared his throat as he quickly thought up a plausible answer. He definitely had no intention of saying that he’d trained for over a year in a Spec-Op simulation rig or that Penny’s brain was made up of highly classified military hardware. No. He was going to lie… again… Thankfully, his newest lie was going to contain a whole lot of the truth. “Sir, my name is John Freeman, and this here is my sister Penny Polendina. The two of us have done work for the Atlesian Military’s R&D division, during which time we gained a working knowledge of the command structure, doctrine, organization and tactics used by both Vale and Atlesian Militaries.”

“Why would a teenager working in the R&D field need to know so much about the tactics used by a foreign military,” asked Officer Shaw from far off in right field.

“Sir, among several other things, the two of us worked in the medical robotics field and some of our work ended up being commissioned by the Vale Military,” Jaune answered as he turned to regard Officer Shaw. ”You can’t program a surgical robot to follow a chain of command or stick to military protocol without first knowing the details yourself.”

After exchanging a series of glances back and forth, Shaw and Oetger smiled as if they’d just won the lottery.

“Well well well…” Oetger breathed out with a bright smile for the two teenagers sitting in front of her. “Since the two of you are probably only sitting in this class to receive the quals on your records, and will most likely be bored to tears, me and my associate were wondering if you want to help us with some teacher’s assistant, technical support and odd jobs stuff…”

After glancing aside at Penny again and receiving a look of confirmation, Jaune returned his attention back towards their teachers and steepled his hands atop his desk. “Sir… If the ‘odd jobs’ that you speak of are legal, ethical, not-too-time-consuming, and won’t get us expelled, then we’d be happy to help.”

“Oh, we like you,” Oetger breathed out in a very amused tone of voice as she turned away to walk over to the dais. “Now… Let’s start this class by learning some basic Military chain of command…”
