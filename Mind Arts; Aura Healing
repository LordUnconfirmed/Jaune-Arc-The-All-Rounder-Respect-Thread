In the meantime Platoon number 1 rolled into Beacon Academy’s gym facilities to find the overlarge room quite a bit emptier than it had been just the day before.

It appeared that most of the boys that were filling the gym the day before had given up on using the work-out space as a stage to display their impressive work ethic. The men and women that were present today would most likely be the people who came every single morning, and they were far less concerned with what Jaune and his Platoon were doing.

Jaune made sure to smile broadly at all of the people present in the room as he’d most likely grow to know them pretty well in the days to come, and then he set about helping the less physically active members of his Platoon get set up with appropriate weights and machines. While Jaune fully intended to heal everyone’s ripped up muscles immediately after the workout ended, which would essentially make muscle strain and soreness a non-concern, there was no sense in risking an injury for no apparent reason. Ruby especially, had never lifted a single weight in her whole entire life, so Jaune had her performing floor exercise circuits such as squats, crunches, push ups and sit-ups rather than attempting any actual weight-lifting.

It had to be said that Ruby was acting just a little bit pouty over being “treated like a little kid” as she put it, but she did nod her understanding when Jaune explained how unwise it is to just launch directly into a hard weight-lifting work-out routine.
