Of course, by the time everyone in Platoon number 1 had finished their workout for the day, they were all pretty damned sore, as they’d all exercised quite a bit harder than they’d dare to under normal circumstances. All eight of Jaune’s teammates were aware that they were about to have their torn muscles fully healed and then bolstered through the use of Jaune’s Semblance. What this meant was that they could all work out to the point that they could barely move and then have Jaune immediately bring them back to full combat readiness. It was an advantage that very few other teams attending Beacon could lay claim to, and it would’ve been a huge advantage even without Jaune bolstering their bones and muscles in the process.

Long story short, Platoon number 1 was about to experience an unprecedented explosion of improvement when it came to both their stamina and raw physical power…
