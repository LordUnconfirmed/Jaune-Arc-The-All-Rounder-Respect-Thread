“Fight,” Professor Goodwitch loudly called out.

When Jaune immediately started dashing to the right, so did Breccia. Apparently she’d seen enough of his fighting to know that he liked to poke around, and she wasn’t having any of it. With a snarl of aggression and a strong aura dash, the woman was closing in on Jaune like a bullet and he was pouring on the speed in response.

As a result of having 15 percent of his aura unlocked, which allowed him to use 3 times his baseline attributes, and because both Blake and Pyrrha were putting a lot of time and effort into his training, Jaune was able to perceive and keep up with Breccia’s katana as it careened towards his neck. When Breccia’s sword was only a foot away, he eased back just half a foot to dodge the tip of the blade, punched the girl in the nose with the pommel of his sword, and then sawed his blade down the length of her right arm. Of course neither of his blows had the strength of his entire body behind them, but his opponent was momentarily stunned by pain and surprise, and was sent cartwheeling backwards to regain her balance.
