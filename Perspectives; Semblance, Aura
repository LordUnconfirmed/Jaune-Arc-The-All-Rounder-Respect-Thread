When the two men finally settled back down at the table again it was with twin businesslike expressions on their faces.

It was time to talk shop.

“I am indeed doing my part to plan out a way that your Semblance can increase the longevity of a human being,” Pietro announced as he steepled his hands on the table. “Are you doing your part Jaune? Are you improving your ability to visualize and manipulate smaller matter like the chromosomes or genetic material contained inside of your cells? Have you learned how to engineer your body at the genetic level?”

“Not yet. I keep trying every night just before bed, but manipulating matter that small is still far too complex to be done with any consistency. Thankfully, I’ve accidentally discovered a technique that I’m pretty sure will help me improve my success rate,” Jaune replied.

“By accident?” Pietro wanted an explanation. That much was obvious.

“Yesterday, I was in the midst of losing a spar, and I needed to perceive exactly how I was being attacked,” Jaune explained with a shrug. “In my desperation, I activated every part of my brain at exactly the same time by manipulating my nervous system using my Semblance. In doing so, I very briefly managed to give myself a level of cognition that I’ve never experienced before. The elevated state of cognition was powerfully hard to accomplish and the hyper-perception that I experienced nearly overwhelmed me, but it worked and I immediately saw the gimmick behind my opponent’s Semblance. I’m going to begin practicing this technique, and I hope to be able to perceive smaller and smaller matter as a result.”

“It’s a good idea,” Pietro slowly acknowledged. “Complete mind mastery though… Woah.”

Once again, Jaune merely nodded because, yes, woah…

“Okay, well then, here’s what I want you to keep in mind while you're practicing,” Pietro began as he leaned in over the table and rested his chin on his forearms….
