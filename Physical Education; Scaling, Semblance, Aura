“Is my Semblance really that much of a liability when it comes to achieving a normal variety of aura control,” Jaune suddenly asked as he stared down at his entirely too gorgeous mentor.

Goodwitch instantly stopped moving at Jaune’s question, even as her hand was pressing an electrode down against the top of his thigh.

“Mr. Arc… Jaune Arc,” Goodwitch slowly enunciated, reminding Jaune that she already knew exactly who he was. “You’ve only had access to your aura for a little over two years now. Most young huntsmen trainees don’t see noticeable amounts of improvement in the application of their aura for nearly five years. Even then, the things that these normal trainees are able to accomplish with their aura are usually extremely simple and weak. Your Semblance has allowed you to keep up with Beacon level Hunters and Huntresses that’ve been training since they were children. Your Semblance is not a liability.”

“I… see,” Jaune responded with a grateful smile on his face. “Thank you for explaining that to me. I don’t yet know what normal looks like for a Huntsmen trainee. I don’t fully understand what I‘ve missed.”
