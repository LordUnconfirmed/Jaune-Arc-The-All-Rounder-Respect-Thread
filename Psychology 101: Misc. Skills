 "While overwhelming strength is definitely an efficient way of attracting a Hunter, nobody said that it's the only way to appeal to a woman."

"So Creep Boy thinks that he's appealing huh?" Yang's skepticism was loud and clear for everyone to hear.

While Jaune did bristle a bit at Yang's continued use of that annoying nickname, the self assured grin never completely slipped off of his face. "Wellâ€¦ If attracting my partner of choice based on my looks, charm or Hunter skills doesn't work out for me, I could always try to impress them with my more than stellar househusband abilities. I can balance a budget, cook, bake, clean, sew, and paint. I also know how to weld, repair a car, maintain an airship or custom build a high spec computer."

"You definitely didn't grow up out in the wilds then," Ren pointed out with just a hint of accusation in his voice. "I thought you didn't go to a preparatory school because you were living in some no nothing colony."

"What I said was that I didn't go to a prep school and that I came from far away," John defended in an even tone. "I told you the truth, but the words "far away" don't necessarily mean the outer wilds."

"John's from somewhere in Atlas, but that's all we've gotten out of him so far," Yang revealed in a mischievous tone of voice. "He claims he spent 2 years on the run from some mysterious group, but he shuts us down whenever we ask for more details."

"I don't trust you with those details because you continue to prove that I can't," John suddenly bit out in an extremely frustrated tone of voice. "My coming here from Atlas isn't a sensitive topic, but the fact that I've been on the run definitely is. You never once thought about why I might be keeping secrets from you, because you have absolutely no tact whatsoever."
