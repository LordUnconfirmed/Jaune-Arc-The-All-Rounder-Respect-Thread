The woosh and crash of rapidly moving metal slamming into metal resounding throughout the clearing as Jaune defended himself from his trainer's attacks, launched a rapid stab of his sword that led into a hard hooking punch using the knuckle duster attached to its hilt, and then instantly turned his body to shield Taiyang's return punch to the back of his head. It wasn't enough. He wasn't moving fast enough. Jaune was getting better and better at channelling aura throughout his brain and eyes to think, see and react faster, but his body wasn't able to keep up with what he needed from it yet.

He could still move faster… He knew it. He could feel it….

If Jaune was ever going to land a hit on Taiyang Xiao Long, he needed to widen and strengthen the nerves threading throughout his body, he needed to bolster and improve the tensile strength of his fast twitch muscles, and he needed to support his joints and tendons to endure the torsion force and the rapid contractions that he was putting them through. He also needed to use one of the hundreds of stabs, sword strokes, parrys, kicks, punches, headbutts, grabs, throws, and environmental distractions that his trainer kept screaming at him to use, with perfect timing and impossibly flawless technique… Long story short, Jaune needed to focus on so many different things all at the same time that the fundamentals slowly but surely slipped through his fingers and Jaune felt himself slowing down again.

Then it finally happened and it wasn't a surprise in the least.
