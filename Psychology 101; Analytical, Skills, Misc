Weiss sighed and then began rattling off every instance of John being suspiciously useful to her in recent memory. "Two weeks ago, John just happened to be around to help me save the airship that we flew across the ocean on when it was suddenly overrun by pirates. We met again outside of the school yesterday, where he defended my honor from some random girl who appears to hate my family, and then he stood next to me in the auditorium when he noticed that I was alone. After the assembly, he persuaded me to spend the night with some local girls that he trusts by claiming he'd leave me alone from that point forward. He broke our deal just now by calling out to us. I suspect he was trying to keep my ambitions from driving a wedge between you and I. I'll say it again. John's a professional. He reads people with uncanny accuracy, he's subtle, and while I know that he's a good person, he's a skilled actor that can and has deceived me in the past."
