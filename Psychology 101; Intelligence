"Tests within tests within tests," the black ribboned girl suddenly whispered from Jaune's left hand side. The way the girl was staring at him paired with her words made it clear she thought that he was a part of the test. The suspicion in her eyes wasn't malicious, but she clearly thought that he was a 'plant,' a student that was on Beacon's payroll as a spy or informant.

"Why do so many people immediately assume that I'm an imposter," Jaune groused to himself.

"There's just no way you're a normal student," The black ribboned girl quietly responded. "Too informedâ€¦ Too quick... Too polished... Waaay too meddlesome... You're a plant. You're staff."

"It upsets me that your life experiences have made you this cynical," Jaune whispered, even as he bobbed his head in a thoughtful manner. "Still... No. I'm not a plant. My name's John Freeman and I'm no less a student here than you are. Ozpin doesn't need spies policing students or delivering information. He made it abundantly clear during his earlier explanation that we're not going to be of any use to Croftlan unless we work in larger numbers. We can either choose to work together or we can choose to be of no help at all. I want to help."

"That sounds exactly like something a plant would say," black ribbon girl pointed out with just the smallest of grins on her face.
