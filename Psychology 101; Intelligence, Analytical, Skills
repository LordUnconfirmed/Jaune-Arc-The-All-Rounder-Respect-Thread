Walking back over to Weiss and Pyrrha, Jaune extended his hand out towards the redhead. "It's nice to meet you Pyrrha. My name's John Freeman. I learned about you and your accomplishments a little over two weeks ago, and that's despite the fact that I've never watched an Arena fight in my life. My suggestion to you, if I'm correct and you do in fact desire some anonymity, is that you put away the tiara for an afternoon, buy a wig and a baggy sweater and be completely honest with both your team and your friends. A little personal freedom and downtime isn't an unreasonable request."

Turning his attention towards the heiress next, Jaune arched an eyebrow at the girl. "This may not be the explanation that you were seeking Weiss, but I want you to tell me something. Why did you travel clear across the ocean to go to Beacon Academy, instead of attending Atlas?"

"That's a stupid question," Weiss immediately grumbled. "You know very well that I wanted freedom from my father and all of the other people that were trying to treat me like a pawn in their chess gameâ€¦" As Weiss's words slowly trailed to a stop, she looked down at her feet and then back up at Pyrrha. "My apologies Ms. Nikos. It appears I've been rather thoughtless regarding your feelings."

Up until that moment, Pyrrha's mouth had been bobbing open and shut in her surprise and shock. Now that both Jaune and Weiss were looking to include her in their back and forth, she shook the confusion from her face and visibly attempted to form a response. "How... but... I haven't said a word about... Am I just that transparent?"

"No. Rest assured that you're not," Weiss replied, once again in a sullen sounding grumble. "John's just a freak that way. If you decide to have anything to do with this impertinent boy, be prepared for him to meddle in your affairs and learn intimate details about your life that he has no business knowing."
