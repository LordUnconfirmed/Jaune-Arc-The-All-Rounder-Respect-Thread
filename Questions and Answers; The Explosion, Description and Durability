"Near the end of the incident, you quickly explained to Ms. Schnee how Mr. Freeman was splitting a large amount of water into a volatile mixture of oxygen and Hydrogen gasses," Ozpin announced into the silence. "I'm an aura specialist rather than a chemist. I've never had the time required to learn such an obscure branch of science. Do you believe that Mr. Freeman could cause that explosion again? Is his Semblance capable of that kind of widespread destruction?"

"John converted well over 200 tons of water into those two different gasses," Penny immediately replied. "He could only recreate that explosion if he could make physical contact with that much fresh water again, and that outcome is extremely unlikely during a fight. There are other ways that John can do similar things with the elements present all around us, but they'd never be as large scale or anywhere near as dramatic."
