Boom!

Very suddenly, a massive column of roiling steam and billowing dust spilled out of the gorge following a rapid but intense ball of white hot flames, Glynda's mouth hung open and her movement slowed to a crawl as she took in the violently churning, superheated conflagration below. Had the Airfield's entire stockpile of red Dust just caught fire and exploded? Was she about to find a crater in the earth where the Airfield used to sit?

Moving a little higher to avoid the massive column of superheated air and dust that was rising up into the sky, Glynda floated herself down towards the end of the gorge and then approached the situation from the opposite side.

What she found at the bottom of the gorge was unexpected enough that the situation became completely surreal for her.

The Airfield was, for the most part, intactâ€¦ The Airfield had weathered the siege.

It was incredible.

Floating her boulder down towards the noticeably dented barrier fortification to park it atop the sole remaining machine gun emplacement, Glynda assessed the situation with a professional eye. Someone, somehow, had set off a massively powerful explosion down in the kill zone outside of the barrier wall that had created an enormous bowl shaped creator in the earth, and the Grimm that had been outside of the blast radius were only now managing to fill that crater up to ground level. There were still 1 or 2 A and B ranked Grimm that were down there amongst the rabble, but they, along with the rest of the surge, would need several minutes to climb back up to the height of the ramparts, and in the meantime Glynda would be able to crush them all with impunity.
