When Miltia blurred by his chest and swept a clawed hand at his neck, Jaune instantly lashed out in a blur of barely controlled speed, managed to catch the girl around the forearm with crushing strength, heaved her body around his own with all of his armor bolstered strength, and slammed the girl directly into her sister when she attempted to kick him from behind. Then, even as both girls flew across the room towards a more secluded area of the bar, he followed at an absurdly powerful sprint, and slashed his gauntlet dagger into the side of Miltia's thigh and knee.

Of course, when the Malachite twins finally slammed into a concrete wall in the corner of the bar, it was feet first and with a counter-attack already in mind, and they launched themselves back at Jaune with their weapons weaving an impossibly complex web of slicing metal.

Jaune's eyes could take in and perceive the trajectories of the twin's newest high speed barrage of attacks. Likewise, his armor bolstered body was capable of moving fast enough to avoid the blows. Unfortunately for Jaune, neither of these facts made the act of utilizing his entire brain at exactly the same time anything but a torturously painful and overwhelming experience...

As his perception of time slowed, and the sensory data that he was receiving both broadened and intensified several times over, the slightest sensation that Jaune experienced suddenly became an event, it became an outpouring of information that barraged his mind in a tidal wave of miscellaneous data.

-He felt his diaphragm heaving to create negative pressure outside of his lungs in order to have them expand and draw in the oxygen that his body needed so desperately
-He felt his heart steadily pumping red hot blood throughout his veins to an extent that made him aware of just how liquid the human body really was
-He felt his sweat being pumped out of his various glands to flush through the layers of his dermis and bead in between his skin and his suit
-He felt his muscles screaming with lactic acid buildup to an extent that he'd never noticed in the past, and he noticed the oxygen in his blood breaking it back down into a mixture of carbon dioxide and water
-He felt the electrical signals that were being sent back and forth along his nervous system hundreds of thousands of times a second all over every inch of his body, as if his mind was a violent storm lashing his body with lightning that powered his thoughts and movements
-He felt his aura pulsing, shifting, soothing and activating every cell within his body, as he moved faster than he'd ever moved in his whole entire life and yet experienced it at nothing more than a painfully slow and plodding crawl.

Jaune was sensing it all, everything, all at once, and it was akin to an explosion of knowing, a violently awful, all consuming, present, that simultaneously aided and punished him with every single millisecond that passed.

At the same time, it was working. It was enough… and that was all that mattered…
