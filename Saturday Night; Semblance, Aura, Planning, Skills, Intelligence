Now that he'd activated his reactive armor up to 60 percent, Jaune only had a little over six minutes remaining in his aura usage. Thankfully, at this point, he was mostly making use of the armor in order to impart a sense of shock and awe. The reason for that decision was simple. Considering the lengths that these girls had been willing to go in order to injure him, merely defeating them wasn't going to be anywhere near enough. No... Jaune needed to win his current fight so thoroughly, so decisively, he also won any other fights that the twins might think of having in the future…

He needed to make himself lethal… He needed to make himself cruel...

He needed to scare the living shit out of the Malachite sisters…

With that much in mind, Jaune concentrated his aura into the armor around his hands until two pitch black double edged daggers formed and extended out past his wrists as if he was wearing assassin gauntlets. Next his attention turned towards his elbows, where twin spikes grew into place as if he was wearing a particularly cruel set of plate armor. Finally, with a slow and almost indifferent crack of his neck, he began stalking towards the twins like an alpha predator.

The twins didn't like what they were looking at. They didn't like it at all.
