Instead of launching in Pyrrha's direction, Dove Bronzewing immediately aimed his rifle-sword at Pyrrha's body and began firing Dust round after Dust round at her with a desperate intensity that made it clear he thought this was his one and only chance. Pyrrha was completely unarmed, which was apparently giving Mr. Bronzewing hope that he could damage her merely by spamming projectiles at her upper body.

The boy was wrong.

With a sharp stomp of a high-heeled shoe down against the rim of a discarded drink tray, Pyrrha bounced the metal disk up and into her hands just in time to wave it in front of her chest and deflect a rapid barrage of Dust rounds up towards the ceiling. Then she was spinning and swerving towards the boy in a rapid blur of motion that had his eyes widening in alarm and his sword waving back and forth in a desperate bid to keep her at a distance.

Pyrrha would have to admit that she was disappointed. Dove Bronzewing was a massive let-down. For all the posturing he does whenever he's with his friends or team, he was only capable of that kind of bravery when he had a clear advantage. The boy was a chump, a fool, a loser. He was waving his free hand down towards the ground as if he was hoping for some sort of miracle to save him...
