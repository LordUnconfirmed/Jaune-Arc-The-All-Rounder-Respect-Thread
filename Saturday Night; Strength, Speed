Without a single moment's hesitation, Jaune kicked off of the wall on both sides of Miltia's newly struggling body, flew back towards Melanie just as she rose to her feet, and was just in time to rabbit punch her right in the chest with both of his gauntlet daggers. Even after delivering such a powerful and damaging attack, he didn't relent in the least. He had no intention of allowing Melanie to ragdoll away from their fight and potentially regain her bearings. With that in mind, he grabbed the woman around her knife bladed ankle just before his own attack could launch her clear across the bar, and then he began swiveling in place at a rapid rate to swing her around his body in a blur of speed that would make Ruby proud.

A moment later, when the timing was juuuust right, Jaune finally released Melanie's legs and watched her soar towards his target.

When Miltia finally managed to clear the grit out of her newly stinging eyes and pull her body from within the crater that she'd created in the wall, she found Melanie's body flying at her at the speed of a Dust round and both girls were slammed back into the concrete of the wall in yet another explosion of gritty grey dust.

Even as Miltia could be heard coughing and hacking and scrabbling to pull herself out of the wall again, a rhythmic pounding sound began impacting against the ground over and over again. Then, a few seconds later, when the squad leader of team MMAD finally managed to crawl out of the dusty cloud that she'd created in the concrete wall, she was still much too far away to stop what she saw happening.
