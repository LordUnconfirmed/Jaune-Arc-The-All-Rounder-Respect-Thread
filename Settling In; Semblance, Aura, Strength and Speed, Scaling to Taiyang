“Ever since I learned to use my Semblance, the ability to move and manipulate extremely tiny objects such as the cells and the chemicals that make up my body, I’ve been manually altering and repairing my physique little by little over time,” Jaune began with a wave down at his own body.

“Altering your body,” Yang repeated with a newfound wariness in her voice.

“Yes, altering my body,” Jaune immediately repeated. “While I was actually pretty fit to start with, my normal muscles have all been modified into an extremely dense variety of fast twitch muscles since then, and they represent far more speed and tensile strength than their appearance would normally indicate. Likewise, the calcium phosphate and collagen that make up my bones are strung together in an extremely durable weave pattern similar to, but quite a bit stronger than fiberglass. Contrary to what my more acrobatic body type looks like, I’m actually quite strong without ever channeling my aura, and I’m very, very durable…”

“If you ever learn to make full use of your aura...,” Yang began.

“Monster,” Blake agreed.

“It might take full use of my Semblance to take him down,” Pyrrha mused as if to herself.

“I want in,” Nora yelled out with a pump of her arm up in the air and a maniacal smile on her face.

Blake suddenly looked torn in two different directions.

By now, Jaune was just a little bit embarrassed because he didn’t think a mere strength or speed gain was going to make him the match of the Arena Champion Pyrrha Nikos. If the way that the girls were thinking was correct, then Jaune would’ve won against Taiyang while he was wearing his reactive armor. He hadn’t… Strength and speed doesn’t trump training or technique. Jaune had to continue working on his martial arts and that much was obvious… Still… Jaune was quite happy that his teammates could see his potential.
