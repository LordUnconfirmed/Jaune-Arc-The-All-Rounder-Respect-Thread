“What are you doing here kid,” a burly man wearing Security BDUs and holding a machine gun called out as Jaune approached him.

“My name’s John Freeman and this is my partner Blake Belladonna,” Jaune began as he gestured behind himself at Blake’s rapidly approaching form. “My partner and I are Hunters and we're here to assist you in defending the walls until further backup arrives.

“My name’s Alec Foley, and while I’m grateful for any variety of support at all, I don’t see how 2 teenagers, even 2 teenaged Huntsmen will make any difference.” The Security guard spoke in a somewhat despondent tone of voice and he stared down at the Grimm the whole entire time.

“Well that remains to be seen,” Jaune returned with a very stern and somewhat disapproving tone of voice. “If I requisition all of the resources that are just laying around the Airfield unused and direct some of the civilians to perform tasks that won’t immediately make any sense to you, will you oppose me?” Along with his question, Jaune gave the man a look that conveyed that opposing him would be a very bad idea.

“No! Not at all,” Alec immediately replied. “Everything within these walls, including us, will be torn to pieces by the end of the day if the Grimm aren’t stopped, so you can have atter!”

“Very good,” Jaune allowed as he gestured down at the Airfield’s main terminal where a large group of civilians were huddling against the walls. “If I wanted some volunteers to assist me moving and manipulating some machinery, is there anyone you’d recommend?”

“She’s scared almost to the point of catatonia at the moment, but if you can get through to her, there’s a skilled engineer down there by the name of Payla who…”

“Wait! Did you just say that she’s an engineer named Payla,” Jaune gasped out in his surprise.

“Uhh yeah, that’s what I said,” Alec responded with a look of confusion on his face.

Turning to look at Blake, Jaune pointed at himself and then down at the Airfield Terminal. “I have an idea that should make defending the wall quite a bit more manageable, but I’m going to need some help. I’m going to go down there and recruit some people. Can you keep me abreast on the level of the Grimm?”

With one look over the edge of the rampart wall at the Grimm mass that was growing larger by the second despite the endless stream of Red dust rounds tearing it to pieces, Blake silently nodded her head.
