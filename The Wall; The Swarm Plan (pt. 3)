When someone on Remnant thinks of an Airfield, the first 2 materials that immediately come to mind are Red and Black dust. In almost all VTOL style airships, red Dust causes the combustion and black Dust is the spark, the trigger, the explosion, the pop.

What people tend to forget is all of the other varieties of Dust that go into making an Airfield a very streamlined and efficient operation. Blue dust is used to keep the tarmac from warping under the superheated air ejected from especially large VTOL airships taking off. Brown dust is used to repair the tarmac and concrete from routine wear and tear. Yellow Dust provides the electricity to power nearly a mile of conveyor belts moving both fuel and components around the entire complex.

Plenty of different Dust goes into the maintenance and function of an Airfield and yet none of it was being used in its defence.

Jaune was about to change that…

“Grab every baggage gurney and passenger trolley that you can find in the entire compound and bring them to me here at the base of the wall,” Jaune ordered as he began grabbing barrels and crates and moving them to a space that he’d set aside. He already had a civilian with no engineering background smashing open all of the vending machines in the entire facility to bring him as many screw lid pop bottles as he could possibly find.

“You better pick up the pace John,” Blake called down from her spot up on the wall, her voice far more anxious than Jaune had ever heard from her before. “The number of Grimm piling into the gorge has doubled if not tripled since we first came down here! They’re already managing to pile up to about 15-16 meters the height of the wall! We’re running out of time!”

“With a quick nod and a nervous bite to his bottom lip, Jaune began doling out precise mixtures of 1 part black Dust 5 parts blue into a row of glass bottles sitting on his table. This kind of fast and dirty roadside chemistry using Dust would normally be an excellent way of killing yourself, but since he had dominion over extremely tiny things, he could settle all of the dust into place in the bottles as gently as physically possible. Monty Oum only knows why, but when Dust is actually contained inside of an airtight container it becomes far less reactive and prone to exploding than when it’s being moved around in the open air. Science and Dust only loosely coincide, so Jaune was just thankful that Dust had 1 or 2 constants that could be relied upon.
