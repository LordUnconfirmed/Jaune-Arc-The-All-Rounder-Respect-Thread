When the civilian that was collecting all of the Airfield’s bottles finally arrived, Jaune asked the man to bring him the large signs that denote entrances 1 through 4 in the terminal. Then he continued his Semblance assisted mad science until he had nearly 40 pop bottle ice grenades and 60 electric grenades ready to be thrown over the wall.

It wasn’t going to be anywhere near enough…

Around the time Jaune finished preparing his ad-hoc explosives, Payla and her co-workers finally returned with nearly 2 dozen gurneys and trolleys, lining them up on Jaune’s right hand side.

“Hoookay, here’s the deal,” Jaune began as he rose from his work bench and moved towards the closest gurney. “40 meters of wall is much too much space for Blake and I to defend, even with those huge machine guns firing red Dust rounds down over our shoulders. I need to shorten the distance that the 2 of us need to focus our attention.”

“How will we,” Laura, one of Payla’s 2 co-workers began, only for Payla to put a hand on her shoulder to silence her.

With a quick nod of thanks in Payla’s direction, Jaune activated one of the gurneys and it floated up a single foot away from the ground. Then he tore off the control bank at the front of the machine and began rewiring it with a very specific goal in mind. As he worked, he pulled the gurney towards the base of the wall and then braced it on its side with its bottom facing the 3 engineers. About 20 seconds later, when he was finished with his rewiring, he gestured for Bernadette, Payla’s third co-worker, to slowly approach the gurney.

While at first Bernadette had no trouble at all approaching John and his turned over gurney, when she closed to about 4 meters away from the piece of machinery, she suddenly lost her balance and was forced backwards into a fast paced roll.

“Wha… How…” Laura called out.

“These gurneys make use of Purple Gravity Dust in order to float a foot off the ground,” Jaune explained with a smile on his face. “All I did just now was reverse the direction that the gurney is casting its gravity, supercharged its output to way above maximum, and this is the result. Of course neither the gurneys nor the trolleys will survive being used at this power output for very long, but I suspect they’ll work long enough for the cavalry to arrive.”

“Ingenious,” Payla breathed out as she stared at the neat little rows of gurneys and trolleys that they’d just brought over. “How are we going to affix them all to the top of the wall in time?”

Turning towards the table, Jaune pulled out a large box full of brown Dust and waved at it as if he was a beautiful assistant on a gameshow. “Earth Dust replicates whatever mineral or ore it’s crushed against in a bulbous rocky mass. If I slam it down against 2 sections of steel plate, then a large steel ingot will immediately form and bind the two sections together. I plan to use the Airfield’s entire supply of brown Dust to flash weld all of these gurneys to the top of the rampart wall. Then we’ll turn them on and...”

“And they’ll push the Grimm both down and away from the wall over and over again,” Payla finished in an absolutely astonished tone of voice. “The Beowolves and Ursa won’t be able to dogpile their way up and over the wall.” Then Payla paused as she counted the number of gurneys and made a rough estimate of their combined length. “We don’t have enough to work with though... We won’t be able to cover the entire wall.”

“3 quarters if we’re lucky,” Jaune agreed with a very serious nod. “Blake and I are still going to have to get our hands dirty, but this will help us concentrate our efforts in a much smaller amount of space.”

The entire time that Jaune and Payla had been speaking, her 2 co-workers had been studying the rewiring that he’d completed on the first gurney. By the time Jaune finished his explanation and called out for them all to get started, they simply nodded their understanding and quickly moved towards gurneys of their own.
