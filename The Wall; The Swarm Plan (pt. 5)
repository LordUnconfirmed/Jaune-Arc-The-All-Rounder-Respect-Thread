A little over 15 minutes later, the anti-gravity sleds were all rewired, and Payla was holding the last gurney in place so that Jaune could Dust weld it to the top of the wall. At this point, around 24 anti-gravity sleds were thrumming with power from where they were spanning both the left and the right side of the wall, making the gravity being applied directly beneath the rampart barrier 5 or 6 times stronger within a range of 4 meters.

Any Grimm that attempted to form a cheerleader pyramid beneath these anti-gravity sleds would be both slammed down and cast away from the wall by one of the oldest and most powerful forces in the universe. Of course this still left a 10 meter gap in the center of the wall that didn’t have a gravity barrier, but with everyone’s help, Jaune had covered as much space as possible, and their chances of survival were quite a bit better than they’d been just 15 minutes earlier.

The timing of the job’s completion couldn’t have been more perfect either, but that outcome was an extremely frightening one considering how fast Jaune, Payla, Laura, Bernadette, Blake, Alec and the dozen or so other people comprising the Security team had just moved, how the machine guns had been pouring a veritable river of fire down into the main body of the Grimm surge the whole entire time, and the fact that the Grimm had only been about halfway up the wall when they first started. Every single human residing inside of Croftlan’s Airfield had just experienced an extremely close call...
