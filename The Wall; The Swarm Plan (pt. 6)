At this point, the Grimm surge was howling, scratching, and baying just five meters below the top of the ramparts, with the effect that Payla shook and shivered with every single step that she took. On the other hand, the female engineer continued to do her part to the best of her ability despite the extreme fear that she was experiencing, and that was far more than Jaune had expected from anyone when he first arrived at the Airfield.

“Good, it’s done. Now let’s finish getting these number signs welded to the wall,” Jaune suggested.

“Why are we numbering different segments of the wall 1 through 4,” Payla asked as she grabbed the number 4 sign, pressed it to the top of the wall and closed her eyes to ignore the Grimm that were snarling at her from just a few meters away.

“I’m going to need someone with a really good throwing arm to lob all of the Blue and yellow Dust grenades I’ve mixed up over the wall,” Jaune replied as he coaxed the brown Dust to meld the last sign to the rampart wall. “If I yell out zone number 1 for example, then that area is being flooded by far more Grimm than Blake and I can handle, and we’re in need of some area of effect damage. We only have about 100 of the bombs so we’ll need to use them very, very efficiently.”

Due mostly to the fact that she had a completely useless throwing arm, Payla looked to both Laura and Bernadette with a questioning look in her eyes.

A wicked smile immediately grew across Bernadette’s face as she windmilled her right arm in a large clockwise circle. “My team, the Huntresses, have been the women’s softball champs 3 years in a row,” she called out with a crack of her neck. “You call out a number and I’ll rain down death from above.”

Jaune smiled at the woman before turning back towards Payla. “One more thing Payla and this is important. I need you to go get the refuelling truck, fill it with as much water as it’ll hold, connect every single hose that you can find to the tank, and then drive it over to the base of the wall. I’m going to need a huge supply of fresh water at the top of the wall and I’m going to need it at a moment’s notice.”

“Turning back to the massive cistern of water in the far corner of the Airfield and then the refuelling truck near the garage, Payla bit her bottom lip in concern. “Filling the refuelling truck with that much water will take me at least 20 minutes.”

“If everything goes to plan then that might be perfect timing,” Jaune assured Payla with as confident a smile as he could manage. “Now… Blake and I need to get back to areas 2 and 3 of the wall. The central span is about to become Grimm central… It's time we get to work…”

As if to accentuate Jaune’s words, the anti-gravity sleds that they’d only just finished installing on the wall suddenly began doing their job with a series of frenetic whirring noises and small energetic pops. Scattered clusters of piled up Grimm all along both the right and the left side of the central span were suddenly being slammed both out and down towards the ground whenever they climbed too close to the top of the wall. The effect made the growing piles of Grimm along those segments of wall look like waves breaking against a cliff face, only uglier and far more violent.

Jaune couldn’t quite stop a look of intense satisfaction from slipping onto his face. No one anywhere had ever tried what he just did. So far as he knew, this was a brand new way of using Dust, so it would be very interesting to find out if it was efficient enough to be officially adopted by the military…

Demonstrating a level of faith that was almost intimidating, Payla never even looked over the wall to confirm that the gurneys were indeed doing their job. With one last completely serious and professional salute, she immediately started sprinting down the stairs leading to the Airfield’s garage and the refuelling truck that it contained. Laura and Bernadette trailed after their more frenzied co-worker at a normal jog, aiming to collect all of the Dust grenades and carry them up to the right side lookout tower.
