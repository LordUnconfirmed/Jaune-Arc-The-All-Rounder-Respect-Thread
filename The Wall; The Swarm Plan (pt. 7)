“Unless you know the ins and outs of a mostly neglected branch of science called chemistry then that’s also going to require a longer explanation, but I promise to give it to you later,” Jaune quickly assured with a slightly frazzled look on his face. “Look… Please ask me something that I can answer with a yes or no.”

After moving closer to stare up into Jaune’s eyes, Blake whispered so that none of the frightened Security Guards off to their right and left would overhear them. “Are any of these tricks and gimmicks that you’ve cooked up actually going to work?”

After opening his mouth to reply, Jaune froze in place, closed his mouth, opened it again and then sighed. “I think it's of paramount importance that I never lie to you Blake. Considering your personality, I believe doing so to be a fatal error in judgment…”

The only response that Blake made in response to Jaune’s words was a nod, but somehow she made that one movement seem even more meaningful than an entire day of explanations.

“The grenades will work just fine until they run out, but we don’t have anywhere near enough of them. Likewise, the anti-gravity barriers will function as intended until they burn out and stop working,” Jaune admitted in a slightly weary tone of voice. “I don’t know how robust these machines were built to be, so I don’t know how long they’ll last when pushed far, far beyond their limits. My plan with the water... that’s going to be very, very dangerous… but only for me.”

Stepping even closer until they were only inches apart, Blake gestured up at the newly red tinted and angrily chirping HUD glasses that she was wearing. Then she gestured down at the fantastically violent surge of Grimm that had grown to be at least 4 times larger than it was back when they first decided to help. “Are the 2 of us about to die, John?”

This time, a look of absolute conviction and determination immediately grew across Jaune’s face as he rapidly shook his head in a negative, mechashifted his shield into its rifle form, and fired a Dust round down into a Beowulf’s face from nearly point blank range. “No Blake! No… We’re going to live... 20 minutes… If we can hold on for just 20 minutes, the day will be ours.”
