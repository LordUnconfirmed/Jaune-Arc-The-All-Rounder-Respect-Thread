For the next ten seconds, everyone on the couch craned their necks to read the list sitting in Yang’s lap, at the end of which time, their suspicion and curiosity dulled back down to normal levels of interest.

“Boo, boring,” Yang finally announced, with a gesture at the list in her hands. “Why do we need all of the survival and military hardware on this list? We’re Hunters and maybe even Officers, but we’re definitely not soldiers.”

 

“Officers Oetger and Shaw are definitely going to end up making us learn how to soldier because you can’t lead what you don’t understand,” Jaune predicted with absolute confidence in his voice. “Even if they don’t, and I’m wrong, I’ll eventually want you all to learn how to set up a secure base of operations in any environment including the wilderness, how to rotate patrols, how to properly use vantage and choke points, and so on and so forth. It's information that might save your life if the shit hits the fan and you end up roughing it far from a colony’s walls.”
